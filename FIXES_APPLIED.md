# Fixes Applied for Vercel Deployment Errors

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: AI Message Generation - Schema Validation Error
**Error:** `500: invalid_type - expected "number" received "undefined" for characterCount and wordCount`

**Root Cause:** The database schema expects `characterCount`, `wordCount`, and `isCompliant` fields, but the code was trying to save a `complianceCheck` field (which doesn't exist in the schema).

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `server/routes-serverless.ts` to properly calculate and save:
  - `characterCount` - Length of generated message
  - `wordCount` - Word count of generated message  
  - `isCompliant` - Boolean based on compliance checks
- Removed the non-existent `complianceCheck` field

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: AI Image Generation - Missing Task ID
**Error:** `500: No task ID received from Freepik API`

**Root Cause:** The Freepik API call is failing, most likely because:
1. `FREEPIK_API_KEY` environment variable is not set in Vercel
2. Or the API response structure is different than expected

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive error logging to see actual API response
- Added detailed error messages showing what the Freepik API returns
- Improved error handling to help diagnose issues
