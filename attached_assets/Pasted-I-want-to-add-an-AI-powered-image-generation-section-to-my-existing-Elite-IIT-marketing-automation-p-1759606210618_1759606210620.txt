I want to add an AI-powered image generation section to my existing Elite IIT marketing automation project. The project is already connected to my GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rushil242/EliteEmailAutomator). 

Add a new image generation feature below the existing AI message generator section in the ai-messages.tsx page with these exact specifications:

FEATURE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create an "AI Image Generator" section positioned directly below the current AI message creator
2. User input: Simple one-line text area for image description (like "Students studying in modern classroom")
3. Two-step AI process:
   - Step 1: Use OpenRouter API with DeepSeek model to enhance/rewrite the user's simple prompt into a detailed, professional prompt optimized for Google Imagen 3
   - Step 2: Send the enhanced prompt to Freepik API using Google Imagen 3 model to generate the image
4. Display the generated image with a download button
5. Show both the original prompt and the AI-enhanced prompt for transparency
6. Include loading states and error handling

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Backend: Add new route "/api/generate-image" in routes.ts 
- Use existing OpenRouter API integration (OPENROUTER_API_KEY already configured)
- Add Freepik API integration using FREEPIK_API_KEY environment variable
- Frontend: Create new component "ImageGenerator" in ai-message-creator.tsx
- Use existing UI components (cards, buttons, inputs) for consistency
- Follow the same error handling and toast notification patterns as message generator

AI PROMPT ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM PROMPT:
"You are an expert prompt engineer specializing in Google Imagen 3 image generation. Transform simple image ideas into detailed, high-quality prompts that produce professional marketing visuals for Elite IIT Coaching Institute.

ENHANCEMENT GUIDELINES:
- Add specific visual details (lighting, composition, colors, style)
- Include professional photography terms (shallow depth of field, golden hour, etc.)
- Specify image quality (high resolution, sharp focus, professional photography)
- Add relevant educational context when appropriate
- Keep prompts under 200 words for optimal Imagen 3 performance
- Focus on clean, modern, inspiring visuals suitable for educational marketing

Transform this simple idea into a detailed Imagen 3 prompt: [USER_INPUT]"

API INTEGRATIONS:
1. OpenRouter API: Use existing setup with model "deepseek/deepseek-chat" for prompt enhancement
2. Freepik API: POST to https://api.freepik.com/v1/ai/text-to-image/imagen3 
   - Headers: "x-freepik-api-key": process.env.FREEPIK_API_KEY
   - Body: { "prompt": enhancedPrompt, "num_images": 1, "aspect_ratio": "widescreen_16_9" }

UI LAYOUT:
Position this new section as a third card below the existing AI message creator, following the same design pattern. Include:
- Card header with robot icon and "AI Image Generator" title
- Input field for simple image description
- "Generate Image" button with loading state
- Results area showing:
  - Original prompt
  - AI-enhanced prompt  
  - Generated image with download button
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
Add FREEPIK_API_KEY to the .env file configuration

Please implement this complete image generation workflow maintaining the existing code structure and design patterns from the current project.
